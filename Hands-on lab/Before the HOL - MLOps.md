# MLOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

   - The Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. Azure DevOps subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure DevOps account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

   > **Note**: You will need privileges to create projects on the DevOps account. Also, you need privileges to create Service Principal in the tenet. This translates to **Ensure that the user has 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Subscription**.

3. Azure Machine Learning service workspace. An Azure Machine Learning workspace is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. It ties your Azure subscription and resource group to an easily consumed object in the service.

4. Azure Machine Learning compute instance. The compute instance is created during Exercise 1 from the hands-on lab. It used as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud to run the quickstart integrated notebooks uploaded in your workspace file share.

## Before the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Install the Microsoft DevLabs Machine Learning plugin for Azure DevOps

1. Navigate to the VisualStudio Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml and select **Get it free**.

2. Select **Azure DevOps organization** from the dropdown list and then select **Install**.

### Task 2: Setup Azure DevOps Agent  

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](http://dev.azure.com).

2. Select **User setting, Personal Access Tokens**.

6. In the `Add agent pool` dialog provide the following information and then select **Create**:
 
    - **Pool type**: `Self-hosted`
    - **Name**: `MCW Agent Pool`
    - **Grant access permission to all pipelines**: `Selected`
    - **Auto-provision this agent pool in all projects**: `Selected`

7. Navigate to **MCW Agent Pool, Agents** and then select **New agent**.

    ![The Agents section of the MCW Agent Pool page is shown, and the New agent button is highlighted.](media/setup-agent-pool3.png 'Add New Agent')

8. From the `Get the agent` dialog, select **Linux, x64**, copy `Download the agent URL` and save it for later use during the setup, and then close the dialog.

    ![The Linux, x64 section of the Get the agent dialog is shown, and the Copy button is highlighted.](media/setup-agent-pool4.png 'Get the Agent')
    
9. Go to Resource Group, from the `Overview` section of the ubuntu virtual machine, copy the **Public IP address** and save it for later use.

   ![Virtual Machine Overview page is shown with copy Public IP address button is highlighted.](media/setup-vm2.png 'Virtual Machine Overview')

10. From an `Azure cloud shell` or `terminal` or `command prompt`, run the following commands:

    - `ssh mlopsuser@xx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (replace the IP address with your VMs public IP address)
       - If you are prompted: `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`, type `yes`
    - Provide password for `mlopsuser`

11. Once you are logged into the VM, run the following commands:

   - `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash`
   - `az extension add --name azure-cli-ml`
    - `curl -O [Download the agent URL copied above]`
        - For example, `curl -O https://vstsagentpackage.azureedge.net/agent/2.191.1/vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.191.1.tar.gz`
   - `mkdir myagent && cd myagent`
   - `tar zxvf ../vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.191.1.tar.gz`
       - Ensure that the `tar.gz` file is the one downloaded above
   - `./config.sh`
       - Accept the Team Explorer Everywhere license agreement now? `Y`
       - Enter server URL > [Provide your Azure DevOps organization URL]
           - For example, `https://dev.azure.com/organization-name`
       - Enter authentication type (press enter for PAT) > press enter
       - Enter personal access token > [Provide the PAT saved above]
       - Enter agent pool (press enter for default) > `MCW Agent Pool`
       - Enter agent name (press enter for mlops-agent) > press enter
       - Enter work folder (press enter for _work) > press enter
   - `sudo ./svc.sh install`
   - `sudo ./svc.sh start`
      > **Note**: to stop the agent run: `sudo ./svc.sh stop`. If required, you can find more details on setting up and configuring Self-hosted Linux agents [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux?view=azure-devops).

12. From within Azure DevOps, navigate to **Organization Settings, Agent Pools, MCW Agent Pool** and then select the **Agents** tab. Confirm that the `mlops-agent` is `online`.
